# Position-Monitoring-System

AIM:
To develop a digitally simulated system that demonstrates real-time acquisition and visualization of accelerometer and gyroscope data using an ESP32 and MPU6050, displayed through a web interface—entirely within a virtual environment on a laptop, without physical hardware.

Problem Statement:
Design and implement a system to monitor the position and orientation of an object. Utilize the simulation tool to display real-time accelerometer and gyroscope data on an OLED screen.

Scope of the Solution:
•	Simulates the ESP32 and MPU6050 sensor interaction in a digital environment.
•	Provides a web-based interface for real-time visualization of sensor data.
•	Enables development and testing of IoT applications without physical devices.
•	Offers a foundation for further extension to cloud integration or advanced analytics.

Required Components to Develop the Solution:
Category	Components (Digital/Software)
Software	- ESP32 and MPU6050 simulator (e.g., Wokwi, Tinkercad, or similar)
Hardware	- None (fully simulated environment)
Cloud	- Optional: MQTT broker simulation or local web server for data streaming/visualization
